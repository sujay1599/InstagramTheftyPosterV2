This Python script automates the process of scraping and uploading Instagram reels using the `instagrapi` library. It allows you to scrape reels from specified Instagram profiles, download them, and upload them with new descriptions, optional hashtags, and credits. The script also supports the periodic deletion of uploaded reels.
