## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Required Python packages (specified in `requirements.txt`)

### Install Required Packages

You can install all the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sujay1599/InstagramTheftyPosterV3.git
   cd InstagramTheftyPosterV3
   ```

2. Install the required packages using `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run `start.py` to create the `config.yaml` file:
   ```bash
   python start.py
   ```
   Follow the prompts to enter your configuration details. This will generate a `config.yaml` file with the necessary settings, including encrypted Instagram credentials.

## Usage

Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Configuration

The `config.yaml` file will be generated by running `start.py`. It includes the following settings:

- **Instagram Credentials**: Provide your Instagram username and password. These will be encrypted and stored securely.
- **Scraping Settings**:
  - `enabled`: Set to `true` to enable scraping.
  - `profiles`: Space-separated list of Instagram profiles to scrape reels from.
  - `num_reels`: Number of reels to scrape per profile.
  - `scrape_interval_minutes`: Interval in minutes between scraping sessions.
- **Uploading Settings**:
  - `enabled`: Set to `true` to enable uploading.
  - `upload_interval_minutes`: Interval in minutes between uploads.
  - `add_to_story`: Set to `true` to add reels to your Instagram story.
- **Description Settings**:
  - `use_original`: Set to `true` to use the original reel description. If `false`, you will be prompted to enter a custom description.
  - `custom_description`: The custom description to use if `use_original` is `false`.
- **Hashtags Settings**:
  - `use_hashtags`: Set to `true` to use hashtags in the reel descriptions.
  - `hashtags_list`: List of hashtags to include in the reel descriptions (if `use_hashtags` is `true`).
- **Credit Settings**:
  - `give_credit`: Set to `true` to give credit to the original poster in the reel descriptions.
- **Deleting Settings**:
  - `delete_interval_minutes`: Interval in minutes between deletions.
- **Comments and Forwarding**:
  - `leave_comment`: Set to `true` to leave comments on scraped videos.
  - `comments`: List of comments to leave if `leave_comment` is `true`.
  - `forward_videos`: Set to `true` to forward videos to groups.
  - `groups`: List of group names to forward videos to if `forward_videos` is `true`.

### Logging

The script maintains a log file (`upload_log.txt`) to keep track of uploaded reels, a status file (`status.json`) to track the last action times, and a random upload times file (`random-upload-times.json`) to log the random sleep times between uploads.

### Dashboard

Run the dashboard script to view detailed information about scraping and uploading activities:

```bash
python dashboard.py
```
