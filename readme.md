# Instagram Thefty Poster V3.2

Instagram Thefty Poster V3.2 builds upon the features of V3.1, introducing several enhancements and new functionalities to improve the automation process of scraping, uploading, and managing Instagram reels.

## Features

### V3.1 Features

- **All Features from V2**: Includes all functionalities from V2, such as scraping reels, uploading with customizable descriptions, adding to stories, interval-based tasks, and encrypted credentials.
- **Enhanced Randomized Actions**: More sophisticated random liking, commenting, and forwarding to simulate human behavior better.
- **Improved Dashboard**: Enhanced dashboard using the `rich` library for a more detailed and visually appealing display of activities.
- **Automated Scheduling**: More robust scheduling for scraping, uploading, and deletion tasks.
- **Detailed Logging**: Improved logging for better traceability and debugging.
- **Additional Configuration Options**: More settings for customization in `config.yaml`.

### New Features in V3.2

- **Enhanced Random Waits**: Added random waits between scraping, liking, commenting, and uploading actions to better simulate human behavior and reduce the risk of detection by Instagram.
- **Logging of Random Waits**: Logged random wait times into a separate file (`random-waits.json`) for better tracking and debugging.
- **Detailed Logging of Comments**: The program now logs the actual comments posted on each reel for better traceability.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling and logging to capture JSONDecodeError and other exceptions, making the script more robust.
- **Improved Dashboard**: Updated dashboard to display detailed information about scraping, uploading, and random wait times, as well as the next file to be uploaded.

## Requirements
